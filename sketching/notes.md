I love making things.

Earlier in my career, I co-founded Perceptor so I could make things (with others). We used design and code to craft experiences and did some awesome stuff in those years. Between the boring work for big-name multi nationals, quirky collaborations with artists, self-initiated projects with complete freedom and bizarre situation working for foreign nations, it was a time I will be forever grateful for.

Over time, I realised that however much I liked making things myself, I got even more energy from helping others make things. So I left Perceptor and joined WeTransfer as CTO, to help my _amazingly talented_ teams make things.

Earlier in my career, I used design and code to do that. While those are still passions of mine, I am currently fascinated by shaping the environment that enables others to make things happen.

Earlier in my career, I used design to make things happen. Gradually, I also got into code, and that culminated into co-founding Perceptor, a studio bringing engineering and design together to create _experiences_. We did some awesome stuff in those years. I'd need more than one hand to count the _number of projects you could make a movie about_, which is a pretty good metric I'd say.

At Perceptor, I designed a lot of things, mostly interfaces, but also increasingly found myself writing code. 


As we grew Perceptor, I got increasingly interested in the people behind work. So much so that I decided to 

Earlier in my career, I used design and code to make things happen. While both are still passions of mine, currently I am focused on creating the best environment for others to make things happen.
