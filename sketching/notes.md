Hi, I'm Bastiaan. I'm into baking, climbing, and helping teams build beautiful software with passion and compassion -- currently as CTO at WeTransfer. I still use email. Care to know more?

From a background in product design and software engineering to being a founder and leader of teams, my professional experience spans the full breadth of software development. 

In 2015 I joined WeTransfer (and I'm still there!). I started out as VP Engineering leading a small team of engineers through the chaos of scaling a start-up and ended up as CTO. I then identified a huge opportunity in Product Management, which was a function we did not have in the company. I was tasked with introducing Product at WeTransfer and took on the CPTO role, combining Product and Technology. After almost 2 years, and with product management being an established part of the company, I reverted back to my CTO role in August 2019 to focus exclusively on engineering. During my CPTO tenture I helped shift the product strategy from being focused on file transfer to _being behind every great idea_. Our ambition is to build a comprehensive set of productivity tools for creatives, enabling them to get their ideas out. In support of that strategy  acquired Paper and Paste from FiftyThree in 2018 and raised a Series B round in 2019.

While I love technology and the magical feeling of _making_ something, my true passing is in bringing people together in ways that lets them do their best work. Engineering is a field not particularly known for empathy or compassion, yet I believe these qualities to be crucial to building cohesive, high-performing teams. I am fascinated by organisational design and the future of work. I love coaching people and helping them find confidence and purpose. I enjoy writing and speaking about my work, and would love to do more of both.

I hold a Bachelor of Design in Animation from the Willem de Kooning Academy and a Master of Science in Media Technology from Leiden University. Between my graduation and joining WeTransfer, I co-founded Perceptor - a design studio where we integrated strategy, design and code to create compelling experiences. Besides work for clients like Wacom, Apple, Shell and World Press Photo, we did a lot of self-initiated projects. I am most proud of Perloo, an excruciatingly hard iPhone puzzle game we created in 2014 that achieved over 1M downloads in its first week. The old Perceptor website is still available and a continuing source of personal nostalgia. After 7 years I needed a change and we closed Perceptor's doors in 2015.

I also love _not working_. For some time now I've been baking the bread we eat at home, and it has become a  (usually) fulfilling routine. Mastering the complexity and depth of sourdough bread will surely keep me entertained for the rest of my life. I am also an avid rock climber of over 20 years. I've been mostly into bouldering but have recently gotten back into lead and top-roping. There is nothing more flow-inducing for me than doing a long multi-pitch route. I have two sons and a lovely fianc√©. They are awesome.
