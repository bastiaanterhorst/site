I love making things.

Earlier in my career, I co-founded Perceptor so I could make things (with others). We used design and code to craft experiences and did some awesome stuff in those years. Between the boring work for big-name multi nationals, quirky collaborations with artists, self-initiated projects with complete freedom and bizarre situation working for foreign nations, it was a time I will be forever grateful for.

Over time, I realised that however much I liked making things myself, I got even more energy from helping others make things. So I left Perceptor and joined WeTransfer as CTO, to help my _amazingly talented_ teams make things.

After 7 years, I left Perceptor to take on an engineering leadership role at WeTransfer, where I am currently CTO.

Earlier in my career, I used design and code to do that. While those are still passions of mine, I am currently fascinated by shaping the environment that enables others to make things happen.

Hi I'm Bastiaan. I'm in love with the explosive cocktail of design, engineering and people that makes up modern software teams.

Hi, I’m Bastiaan. Most of my time is spent on ❤️, climbing, bread-baking and running engineering at WeTransfer -- humans first. I get a kick out of making things.

For as long as I can remember, I have had the urge to make things.

Earlier in my career, I used design to make things happen. Gradually, I also got into code, and that culminated into co-founding Perceptor, a studio bringing engineering and design together to create _experiences_. We did some awesome stuff in those years. I'd need more than one hand to count the _number of projects you could make a movie about_, which is a pretty good metric I'd say.

At Perceptor, I designed a lot of things, mostly interfaces, but also increasingly found myself writing code. 


As we grew Perceptor, I got increasingly interested in the people behind work. So much so that I decided to 

Earlier in my career, I used design and code to make things happen. While both are still passions of mine, currently I am focused on creating the best environment for others to make things happen.

I believe that when it comes to software, engineering and product go hand in hand. I'm motivated by bringing people and technology together to create compelling user experiences. I have a diverse background in design, business and engineering, and am obsessed with organisational developement and creating a working environment where people thrive.

> below the fold

From a background in product design and software engineering to being a founder and leader of teams, my professional experience spans the full breadth of product development. 

I hold a BA in Animation from the Willem de Kooning Academy and a MSc in Media Technology from Leiden University. 

After graduating, I co-founded Perceptor - a design studio where we integrated strategy, design and code to create compelling experiences. Besides work for clients like Wacom, Apple, Shell and World Press Photo, we did a lot of self-initiated projects. I am most proud of Perloo, an excruciatingly hard iPhone puzzle game we created in 2014 that achieved over 1M downloads in its first week. The old Perceptor website is still available and a continuing source of personal nostalgia.

In 2015 I left Perceptor to join WeTransfer, and I'm still there. I started out as VP Engineering leading a small team of engineerings through the chaos of scaling a start-up, ending up as CTO. I then identified a huge opportunity in Product Management, which was a function we did not have in the company. I was tasked with establishing Product at WeTransfer and took on the CPO role in addition to my CTO duties. After almost 2 years, I went back to focussing solely on technology and I am currently CTO. In the mean time we acquired Paper and Paste from FiftyThree Inc. and raised a Series B round. 



I care about people, coaching, communication, organisational design, and the evolution of work

I have deep technical and design, business knowledge

I've been climbing for 20 years, and playing guitar for 3 months. Poetry and philosophy. Bake my own bread.

INSPIRATION

Georg is the co-Founder and CEO of FiftyThree, which started with the belief that people are at their best when they create. Our mission is to put the essential tools for creation within arm's reach. FiftyThree are the makers of Paper (Apple's 2012 iPad App of the Year), and the widely-acclaimed Pencil, the most natural and expressive tool for getting ideas on Paper. In his role Georg connects the dots between engineering, design and business. Before starting FiftyThree, he co-founded the Pioneer Studios, a design venture fund, where he led the incubation of Microsoft Courier. He shipped graphic tools in PowerPoint, Word, Excel, and started a photo frame business with Samsung. While at Microsoft Research he published seminal work on computational photography. He learned his best lessons from teaching, modern dance, and preserving a historic site in Germany. He holds a B.S. from Columbia in Computer Engineering and Economics, and a M.S. in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Product Design from Stanford.
